This explicitly lists *commands* that tell `setuptools` which files should be included or excluded after `setuptools` has done its default processing. There are [quite a few](https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-manifest-in/#manifest-in-commands) commands, but we generally can get away with `graft` or `recursive-include`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- To access the data programmatically from our package code, we'll make the `data` folder a `module` (by including a blank `__init__.py`), and use functions from `importlib.resources` (a built-in python module for python >= 3.7) to read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can choose to use `open` or some hack with `__file__` in your code to find out where your data file is, but this will result in **fragile code that will likely break over time.** (Consider - what if your whole package was zipped up?) `importlib.resources` uses the same mechanism that python uses to load modules, and will always work, now and in the future. Also, remember - you only have to use `importlib.resources` to access data that you pre-package. You can use `open`/`shutil` etc. in functions that you expose to your users to read files at runtime.\n",
