    "1. We wisely named our package `edu-princeton-<netid>-walrus` to avoid conflicts with any existing packages that might already be on PyPI, but this was just to successfully make it available. What if our users wanted to use our walrus package *as well as* the one that is [already available](https://pypi.org/project/walrus/) on PyPI? Which one would `import walrus` use?\n",
    "\n",
    "      In general all hell will break lose in such situations, and user experience will depend on the order in which the packagese were installed. This is almost never a real problem though, as long as package names are unique and wisely chosen. **You will almost always have the two names match exactly.** We just chose different names to illustrate the point. In the rare cases where we *do* want to support names that are already out there (e.g. when writing extensions for packages that others have written), we use something called *namespace packages*. More details at [Packaging namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/).\n",
    "      \n",
    "2. We had to specify our package version twice! (once in __init__.py, and again in `setup.cfg`)!\n",
    "\n",
    "    The former is to allow users to easily inquire `walrus.__version__` programmatically (which has become a convention by now). The latter is to let `pip` do its job properly (for example, if we say `pip install edu-princeton-vineetb-walrus==0.1.0`). Having to specify them independently twice is inconvenient and error prone for sure. We'll see ways to get around this soon.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Why have two files - `pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg`. Can't I put all my package-related information in a single place?\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the future, we may be able to specify some metadata about our package (name/version etc.) directly in `pyproject.toml`. This is an area actively being investigated by the Python community. For now (as of October 2021), `setuptools` is responsible for handling this metadata, and `setup.cfg` is the preferred way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What happened to `setup.py`?\n",
    "\n",
    "    You may see a `setup.py` instead of (or in addition to, a `setup.cfg` file, in a lot of existing projects). There are valid use cases of having a `setup.py`, for example, if you want to do something intelligent (or convoluted) during the build process. If you can get away with just having a `setup.cfg` (i.e. when everything you would like to specify about your package is *static*, so to say), that's the preferred way to go."
