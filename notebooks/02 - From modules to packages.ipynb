This is almost never a real problem though, as long as package names are unique and wisely chosen. **You will almost always have the two names match exactly.** We just chose different names to illustrate the point. In the rare cases where we *do* want to support names that are already out there (e.g. when writing extensions for packages that others have written), we use something called *namespace packages*. More details at [Packaging namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/).\n",

The latter is to let `pip` do its job properly (for example, if we say `pip install edu-princeton-vineetb-walrus==0.1.0`).
