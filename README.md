# Best Practices in Python Packaging 

### Before the workshop

We will be using the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for this course. Anaconda is a popular software that gives us everything we need to get started in Python - the Python 3 interpreter, common Python libraries for scientific computing, plotting and analysis, jupyter Notebooks, and a lightweight IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for more advanced users.

Please ensure that you follow the instructions posted at:
[Workshops that use Jupyter notebooks](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/learn/workshops-live-trainings/requirements-picscie-virtual-workshops#jupyter)
and validate your setup using the sample notebook available as part of the instructions.

 Advanced users may just choose to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). If you do so, please make sure that you have the jupyterlab package installed.
```
conda install jupyterlab 
```

If you are still having trouble installing Anaconda, you may want to try the Binder link in this README to launch the jupyter notebook remotely. Note, however, that you may have limited success with following along most of the tutorial.
